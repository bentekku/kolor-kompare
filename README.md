# Kolor Kompare - Color Palette Web App

One day, while experimenting with ChatGPT, I decided to see if it could suggest good color combinations for web development projects. To my surprise, ChatGPT worked amazingly well and provided some fantastic suggestions. However, I faced a challenge when it came to comparing bulk colors with font color contrast and determining if they worked well together. This led me to create a simple color palette web app called "Kolor.Kompare."

## About Kolor Kompare

Kolor Kompare is a web application designed to help you assess the contrast of colors with different backgrounds and font colors. Instead of generating colors, it acts as a canvas to experiment with font colors against two common background colors: #000 (black) and #fff (white). This can aid in choosing text colors that are easily readable on various backgrounds.
